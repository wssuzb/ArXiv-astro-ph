[Twisted quasar light curves: implications for continuum reverberation mapping of accretion disks.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08638 "Chan 2020, et al.")
>We illustrate the effect with simulated light curves in the LSST ugrizy bands and
examine the impact on the delay measurements when using three different methods, namely JAVELIN, CREAM, and PyCS.
We find that current accretion disk sizes estimated from JAVELIN and PyCS are underestimated by âˆ¼ 30% and that
unbiased measurement are only obtained with methods that properly take the skewed transfer functions into account,
as the CREAM code does.
