:star:[Twisted quasar light curves: implications for continuum reverberation mapping of accretion disks.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08638 "Chan 2020, et al.")
>Illustrate the effect with simulated light curves in the LSST ugrizy bands and
examine the impact on the delay measurements when using three different methods, namely JAVELIN, CREAM, and PyCS.
**Find that current accretion disk sizes estimated from JAVELIN and PyCS are underestimated by âˆ¼ 30%** and that
unbiased measurement are only obtained with methods that properly take the skewed transfer functions into account,
as the CREAM code does. 
>>**Pay attention to the lightcurve y-axis in Fig 2, there may be some wrong with photometric noise errorbar.**
